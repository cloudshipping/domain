//! Building a new message.
//!
//! DNS messages consist of five sections. The first, the *header section*
//! contain, among other things, the number of entries in the following four
//! section which then contain these entries without any further
//! delimitation. In order to safely build a correct message, it thus needs
//! to be assembled step by step, entry by entry. This module provides four
//! types, each responsible for assembling one of the entry sections.
//!
//! You start out with a [`MessageBuilder`] which you can either create from
//! an existing [`Composer`] or, as a shortcut, either completely [`new()`]
//! or from an existing bytes vector via [`from_vec()`]. Like all of these
//! type, the [`MessageBuilder`] allows access to the header section. In
//! addition, it is used for building the *question section* of the message.
//! This section contains [`Question`]s to be asked of a name server,
//! normally exactly one. You can add questions using the
//! [`push()`](struct.MessageBuilder.html#method.push) method.
//!
//! Once you are happy with the question section, you can proceed to the
//! next section, the *answer section,* by calling the
//! [`answer()`](struct.MessageBuilder.html#method.answer) method. In a
//! response, this section contains those resource records that answer the
//! question. The section is represented by the [`AnswerBuilder`] type.
//! It, too, has a [`push()`](struct.AnswerBuilder.html#method.push) method,
//! but for [`Record`]s.
//!
//! A call to [`authority()`](struct.AnswerBuilder.html#method.authority)
//! moves on to the *authority section*. It contains resource records that
//! point to the name servers that serve authoritative for the question.
//! Like with the answer section,
//! [`push()`](struct.AuthorityBuilder.html#method.push) adds records to this
//! section.
//!
//! The final section is the *additional section.* Here a name server can add
//! information it believes will help the client to get to the answer it
//! really wants. Which these are depends on the question and is generally
//! given in RFCs that define the record types. Unsurprisingly, you will
//! arrive at a [`AdditionalBuilder`] by calling the
//! [`additional()`](struct.AuthorityBuilder.html#method.additional) method
//! once you are done with the authority section.
//! 
//! Once you are done with the additional section, too, you call
//! [`finish()`](struct.AdditionalBuilder.html#method.finish) to retrieve
//! the bytes vector with the assembled message data.
//!
//! Since at least some of the sections are empty in many messages, for
//! instance, a simple request only contains a single question, there are
//! shortcuts in place to skip over sections. Each type can go to any later
//! section through the methods named above. Each type also has a `finish()`
//! method to arrive at the final data quickly.
//!
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! To summarize all of this, here is an example that builds a
//! response to an A query for example.com that contains two A records and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//! use domain::bits::{ComposeMode, DNameBuf, MessageBuilder, Question};
//! use domain::iana::Rtype;
//! use domain::rdata::A;
//!
//! let name = DNameBuf::from_str("example.com.").unwrap();
//! let mut msg = MessageBuilder::new(ComposeMode::Limited(512),
//!                                   true).unwrap();
//! msg.header_mut().set_rd(true);
//! msg.push((&name, Rtype::A));
//! let mut msg = msg.answer();
//! msg.push((&name, 86400, A::from_octets(192, 0, 2, 1))).unwrap();
//! msg.push((&name, 86400, A::from_octets(192, 0, 2, 2))).unwrap();
//! let _ = msg.finish(); // get the Vec<u8>
//! ```
