//------------ DName ---------------------------------------------------------

/// A trait implemented by all domain name types.
///
/// The purpose of the trait is to allow building composite types that are
/// generic over all possible variants of domain names. In particular,
/// `DName` is implemented for [`&DNameSlice`] for references to uncompressed
/// domain names, [`DNameBuf`] for owned uncompressed domain names, and
/// [`ParsedDName`] for domain names parsed from DNS messages.
///
/// If you donâ€™t need to include [`ParsedDName`], you might want your type
/// to be generic over `AsRef<DNameSlice>` instead as this allows for the
/// full range of functionality provided by [`DNameSlice`].
///
/// [`&DNameSlice`]: struct.DNameSlice.html
/// [`DNameBuf`]: struct.DNameBuf.html
/// [`ParsedDName`]: struct.ParsedDName.html
pub trait DName: fmt::Debug + fmt::Display + Sized {
    /// Converts the name into an uncompressed name.
    ///
    /// Since unpacking parsed domain names may need allocations to collect
    /// the labels, the return value is a cow. This cow will, however, be of
    /// the borrowed variant whenever possible.
