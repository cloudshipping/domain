//! Resource Records
//!
//! This module defines the [`Record`] type that represents DNS resource
//! records. It also provides a type alias for parsed records with generic
//! data through [`GenericRecord`].

//------------ Record --------------------------------------------------------

/// A DNS resource record.
///
/// All information available through the DNS is stored in resource records.
/// They have a three part key of a domain name, resource record type, and
/// class. Data is arranged in a tree which is navigated using the domain
/// name. Each node in the tree carries a label, starting with the root
/// label as the top-most node. The tree is traversed by stepping through the
/// name from right to left, finding a child node carring the label of each
/// step.
///
/// The record type describes the kind of data the record holds, such as IP
/// addresses. The class, finally, describes which sort of network the
/// information is for since DNS was originally intended to be used for
/// networks other than the Internet as well. In practice, the only relevant
/// class is IN, the Internet. Note that each class has its own tree of nodes.
///
/// The payload of a resource record is its data. Its purpose, meaning, and
/// format is determined by the record type. For each unique three-part key
/// there can be multiple resource records. All these records for the same
/// key are called *resource record sets,* most often shortened to ‘RRset.’
///
/// There is one more piece of data: the TTL or time to live. This value
/// says how long a record remains valid before it should be refreshed from
/// its original source, given in seconds. The TTL is used to add caching
/// facilities to the DNS.
///
/// Values of the `Record` type represent one single resource record. Since
/// there are currently more than eighty record types—see [`Rtype`] for a
/// complete list—, the type is generic over a trait for record data. This
/// trait holds both the record type value and the record data as they are
/// inseparably entwined.
///
/// Since records contain domain names, the `Record` type is additionally
/// generic over a domain name type. 
///
/// There is three ways to create a record value. First, you can make one
/// yourself using the [`new()`] function. In will neatly take care of all
/// the generics through type inference. Secondly, you can parse a record
/// from an existing message. [`Message`] and its friends provide a way to
/// do that; see there for all the details. Finally, you can scan a record
/// from master data (aka zonefiles). See the [domain::master] module for
/// that.
///
/// Records can be place into DNS messages through the value chain starting 
/// with [`MessageBuilder`]. In order to make adding records easier, `Record`
/// implements the `From` trait for two kinds of tuples: A four-tuple of
/// name, class, time-to-live value, and record data and a triple leaving
/// out the class and assuming it to `Class::In`.
