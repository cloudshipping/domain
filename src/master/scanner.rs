//------------ Scanner -------------------------------------------------------

/// A trait for a scanner of master format tokens.
///
/// The master format is using a small number of different token types. This
/// trait provides a way to access a sequence of such tokens. There is a
/// method prefix by `scan_` for each type of token that tries to scan a
/// token of the given type. If it succeeds, it returns the token and
/// progresses to the end of the token. If it fails, it returns an error and
/// reverts to the position before the scanning attempt unless an IO error
/// occured in which case the scanner becomes ‘broken.’
///
/// The methods that provide access to the token’s content do so through
/// closures to let the user decide if and how copies ought to be made. Note
/// that since the scanner may throw away the content at any time after the
/// closure returns, you cannot keep the slice references passed in. This is
/// not on purpose, not a mistake with the lifetime arguments.
pub trait Scanner {
    /// # Fundamental Methods
    ///
    /// Returns whether the scanner has reached the end of data.
    ///
    /// This will return `false` if reading results in an IO error.
    fn is_eof(&mut self) -> bool;

    /// A word is a sequence of non-special characters and escape sequences

    /// method will position at the end of the space sequence if it is
    /// required. That is, you can scan for two subsequent word tokens
    /// without worrying about the space between them.
    ///
    /// A reference to the content of the actual word (ie., without any
    /// trailing space) is passed to the provided closure. This is the raw

    /// the content, it can return something which will then become the
