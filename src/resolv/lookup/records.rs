//------------ lookup_records ------------------------------------------------

/// Creates a future that looks up DNS records.
///
/// The future will use resolver represented by `resolv` to perform a DNS
/// query for the records of type `rtype` associated with `name` in `class`.
/// This differs from calling `resolv.query()` directly in that can treat
/// relative names. In this case, the resolver configuration is considered
/// to translate the name into a series of absolute names. If you want to
/// find out the name that resulted in a successful answer, you can look at
/// the query in the resulting message.
